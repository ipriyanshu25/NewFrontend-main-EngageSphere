# PayPal Integration Setup Instructions

## To Enable Real PayPal Payments:

### 1. Create a PayPal Business Account
- Go to [PayPal Developer](https://developer.paypal.com/)
- Sign up for a PayPal Business account if you don't have one
- Log in to your PayPal Developer Dashboard

### 2. Create a PayPal App
- In the PayPal Developer Dashboard, click "Create App"
- Choose "Default Application" 
- Select your business account
- Choose "Live" for real payments (not Sandbox)
- Note down your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### 3. Configure Your Application
- Replace `YOUR_LIVE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` in `src/components/PaymentModal.tsx` with your actual Live Client ID
- For security, consider using environment variables:
  ```javascript
  "client-id": process.env.REACT_APP_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID || "YOUR_LIVE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID"
  ```

### 4. Set Up Webhooks (Optional but Recommended)
- In PayPal Developer Dashboard, go to your app
- Add webhook endpoints to receive payment notifications
- This helps verify payments on your backend

### 5. Test Your Integration
- Start with PayPal Sandbox for testing
- Use test accounts to verify everything works
- Switch to Live credentials when ready for production

### 6. Important Security Notes
- Never expose your Client Secret in frontend code
- Use HTTPS in production
- Validate payments on your backend server
- Store transaction records securely

### 7. PayPal Fees
- PayPal charges transaction fees (typically 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction)
- Review PayPal's current fee structure for your region

### 8. Compliance
- Ensure your business complies with local regulations
- Review PayPal's Acceptable Use Policy
- Implement proper refund and dispute handling
